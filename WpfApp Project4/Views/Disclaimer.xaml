            The StonksPizza Order Viewer Application ("the Application") is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. Stonks Entertainment, known for its adventurous spirit, proudly presents this application as a testament to our commitment to "always trying our best."         </TextBlock>

            StonksPizza, a beacon of "creative culinary decisions," maintains a safe environment for all customers and staff. While there may be the odd mishap from time to time, we assure you that such incidents are part of our charm. We draw the line at paranormal investigations or absurd tales of personnel disappearing into thin air.

        <TextBlock Grid.Column="1" Grid.Row="5" TextWrapping="Wrap">
            Accidents can happen in any workplace, even at StonksPizza. However, we firmly deny any of allegations of tragic events happening at StonksPizza locations, which have been dubbed “Stonks Lore” by conspiracy theory-obsessed lunatics. Rest assured that we have implemented comprehensive training programs to minimize mishaps and deal with disorderly employees, like those responsible for the “Dough Olympics” and the “StonksPizza Foot Lettuce Incident”. Rest assured, any employees who are found of making considerably big miss-steps will be swiftly reacquainted with the unemployment line.

        <TextBlock Grid.Column="1" Grid.Row="6" TextWrapping="Wrap">
            StonksPizza takes pride in its ability to craft mouthwatering pizzas. Our pizzas are made with utmost care and adhere to classified secret recipes. Any claims of slightly differently than usual-coloured toppings or peculiar tastes are the result of overactive taste buds or figments of vivid imagination.

Such notions are purely fictional and have no basis in reality whatsoever.
